# Brief

This project is a tool for scanning and formatting code projects to generate context optimized for LLMs. It is evolving into an interactive "Developer Toolbox" for analyzing, designing, and reviewing code with AI. The goal is to provide developers with an AI-powered assistant to help them understand, improve, and maintain their code.
